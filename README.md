Recently I was asked to `write my own Vector`(analog of the List in the C# or ArrayList in the JAVA). It seemed interesting to me cause several years ago I 
already wrote some STL classes but my implementation was quite primitive. So I decided to write again some STL classes like Binary or B-trees, Hash-table (_Hello ~~World~~ Google_), Variant & Any.
